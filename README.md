# Algorithms-and-data-structures
My repository for functions I've written whilst studing data structures and algorithms.  
## Aiming to cover:  
### Data Strucutres:  
* Linked Lists  
* Trees, Tries, Graphs  
* Stacks  
* Queues  
* Heaps  
* Vectors / Array Lists  
* Hash Tables  
### Algorithms:  
* Breadth First Search  
* Depth First Search  
* Binary Search  
* Merge Sort  
* Quick Sort  
### Concepts:  
* Bit Manipulation  
* Memory (stack vs heap)  
* Recursion  
* Dynamic PRogramming  
* Big O Time and Space
